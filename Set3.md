### Points to keep in mind

1. The UI should be responsive. To see how Bing looks in responsive mode, open developer tools and click on responsive design icon and refresh the page.

2. You'll need to recreate the following things which are also marked in the below screenshot:
   1. Toolbar
   2. Hamburger menu
   3. Menu opened after clicking on the hamburger menu
   4. Bing search bar
   5. Carousel

## Note: If you do not see carousel on Brave Browser, try opening Bing in Firefox or Chrome
